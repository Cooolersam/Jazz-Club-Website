# Dougherty Valley High School Jazz Club Website

This is the official website for the Dougherty Valley High School Jazz Club.

The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's designed to be easily updatable by club officers, even those with no coding experience.

## How to Update the Website

All the website's content (performances, gallery, officers) is stored in a single file: `data.json`. To update the site, you just need to edit this file directly in GitHub.

**Location of the content file:** [data.json](data.json)

---

### Editing `data.json` on GitHub

1.  Navigate to the `data.json` file in the repository.
2.  Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file) in the top-right corner.
3.  Make your changes according to the instructions below.
4.  Scroll to the bottom and click the **"Commit changes"** button. Your updates will be live on the website in a few moments.

---

### 1. How to Add a New Performance

Find the `"performances"` section in `data.json`. To add a new event, copy an existing performance block and paste it at the top of the list.

**Example Performance Block:**

```json
{
  "day": "18",
  "month": "OCT",
  "title": "Performance at Oakmont Senior Center",
  "time": "2:00 PM - 3:00 PM",
  "location": "Oakmont Senior Living",
  "description": "An afternoon of jazz classics for the residents.",
  "tags": ["Community Event", "Private Performance"]
}
```

-   **Important:** Don't forget the comma `,` between each performance block.

---

### 2. How to Add Photos & Videos to the Gallery

This is a two-step process: first, you upload the media file to the `images` folder, and second, you add its information to `data.json`.

#### Step 2a: Uploading Image Files

1.  Navigate to the `images` folder in the repository: [images/](images/)
2.  Click **"Add file"** > **"Upload files"**.
3.  Drag and drop your image file(s) here.
4.  Click **"Commit changes"**.
5.  Once uploaded, click on your new image file and copy its name (e.g., `my-cool-photo.jpg`).

#### Step 2b: Adding Items to the Gallery

Find the `"gallery"` section in `data.json`. Copy and paste a block and update the details.

**To add an IMAGE:**

```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "category": "performances",
  "url": "images/my-cool-photo.jpg",
  "title": "Spring Concert"
}
```

-   `category`: Must be one of `recent`, `performances`, `rehearsals`, or `members`. This decides which tab it appears under.
-   `url`: Must be `images/` followed by the exact filename you uploaded.
-   `title`: The text that appears when you hover over the image.

**To add a VIDEO (from YouTube or Google Drive):**

You need an **embed link** for videos.

-   **For YouTube:** Right-click the video > "Copy embed code" > grab the `src` URL from the code. It looks like `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`.
-   **For Google Drive:** Open the video > Click the three dots > "Share" > Change "General access" to "Anyone with the link" > Click "Copy link" > Open the link in a new tab > Click the three dots again > "Embed item" > grab the `src` URL. It looks like `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/preview`.

```json
{
  "type": "video",
  "category": "recent",
  "embedUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ",
  "title": "Our latest performance!"
}
```

-   `type`: Must be `"video"`.
-   `category`: Same as for images.
-   `embedUrl`: The special embed link you copied.

---

### 3. How to Update the Officer List

Find the `"officers"` section at the top of `data.json`. Simply edit the names for each role.

**Example:**

```json
"officers": {
  "president": "New President Name",
  "vicePresident": "New VP Name",
  "conductor": "New Conductor",
  // ...and so on
}
```

2.  Open your terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3.  Run the following command:
    -   On Mac/Linux: `python3 -m http.server`
